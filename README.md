# GNPS-Trinity

GNPS-Trinity workflow combines LC-MS feature detection, molecular networking, and in silico annotation.

This workflow is jointly developed by the Dorrestein's Lab (UC San Diego), Theodore Alexandrov's lab (EMBL), and Sebastian Boecker's lab (Jena University) that aims at bringing together LC-MS feature detection tools (OpenMS, Optimus workflow), in silico annotation (Sirius3, CSI:FingerID), and molecular networking (GNPS).

The key improvements are:

    Mapping back the intensity of the LC-MS feature detected across samples as pie-chart diagram directly into the molecular networks.
    Mapping the in silico annotation generated by Sirius3 and CSI:FingerID into the molecular networks.

The GitHub contains the scripts of the workflow. The workflow has been designed by Louis-Felix Nothias (Dorrestein Lab UCSD) and the scripts coded by Madeleine Ernst (Dorrestein Lab and Copenhagen University). They are available as Knime workflows and Jupyter notebooks.

Knime worfklow (recommended): See Optimus GitHub for installation of Optimus and Knime https://github.com/alexandrovteam/Optimus Additionnally you will have to install R https://cran.r-project.org/, as well as the "plyr" package https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html.

Generate_GroupMapping_file_from_Metadata_table_v_0.1_2016.12.07.zip can be used to create a GNPS_group_mapping_file.txt using a metadata_table.csv GNPS_TRINITY_v_0.1_20161207.zip is used to combine the outputs of Optimus and Sirius, in order to import informations into Cytoscape.

Jupyter notebooks: Underconstruction.

See documentation on GNPS for more details https://bix-lab.ucsd.edu/display/Public/GNPS+Trinity+workflow.

Optimus workflow is a LC-MS feature analysis tool using OpenMS, develop by Ivan Protsiuc at Theodore Alexandrov group at EMBL. https://github.com/alexandrovteam/Optimus

Sirius for in silico MS/MS annotation

Sirius3 a new java-based software framework for discovering a landscape of de-novo identification of metabolites using single and tandem mass spectrometry developed by Kai DÃ¼hrkop and Sebastian Boecker at Jena University. This tool uses isotopic pattern, analysis and fragmentation tree to calculate candidate molecular formula, and now also integrates CSI:FingerID to generate candidate structures. https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/
